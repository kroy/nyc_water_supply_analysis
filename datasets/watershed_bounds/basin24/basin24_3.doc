1/04: This feature dataset was imported from the coverage library for initial implementation of the geodatabase.  In several instances, two or more coverages (similar features but differing geographic regions) were combined to create the feature dataset.  This metadata includes the original ascii text from the coverage library documentation, updated and revised where necessary to explain the processing required for geodatabase import.  This metadata will be reformatted for FGDC compliance when time and resources allow.
