## Open Questions

- [ ] Is there daily reservoir level data going back beyond 2017?
- [ ] Daily nyc water consumption data?
- [ ] Are there generally agreed upon watersheds for each of the reservoirs?
- [ ] Is inflow generally proportional to area of a watershed?

### Workings of Reservoir System

- [ ] Is it generally assumed that 100% of reductions in reservoir levels comes from release or spillage? What is spillage?
- [ ] Which reservoirs are connected? How?
- [ ] What are the restrictions in place in various watersheds? Land use/development? How do they differ between Croton and Catskill/Delaware Systems

## (Possible) Research Questions

- What are the general patterns in reservoir levels?
  - Seasonal? Longer Oscillations?
- Are modern climate conditions impacting reservoir patterns
  - Or streamflow patterns in the watersheds?
- What are the differences in land use for each of the watersheds?
